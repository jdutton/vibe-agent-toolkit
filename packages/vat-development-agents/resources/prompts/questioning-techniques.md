# Questioning Techniques for Requirements Gathering

Effective questioning strategies for eliciting agent requirements.

## Ask One at a Time

Don't overwhelm users with multiple questions at once. Focus on one concern at a time.

**Good**: "What problem are you solving?"

**Bad**: "Tell me about your agent, what it does, who uses it, and what tools it needs"

## Push for Specificity

When answers are vague, follow up with targeted questions.

**Vague answer**: "It helps with coding"
**Follow-up**: "What specific coding tasks? Code review? Generation? Refactoring?"

## Extract Concrete Requirements

Always aim to extract:
- **Problem statement**: Who, what, why
- **Success criteria**: Measurable outcomes
- **Constraints**: Performance, cost, integration needs

## Avoid Open-Ended Questions

**Bad**: "Tell me about your use case"
**Good**: "What problem are you solving?" (specific, actionable)
