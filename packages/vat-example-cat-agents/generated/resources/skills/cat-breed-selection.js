export const text = "# Cat Breed Selection Skill\n\nGuide for Claude Code to help users select cat breeds through conversational interaction.\n\n## Purpose: For Claude Code, Not the LLM\n\n**Key distinction:**\n- **This file** = Guidance for Claude Code (how to orchestrate)\n- **Agent resources** = Content for the LLM (what to say/know)\n\nThis skill references agent resources via markdown links but doesn\'t duplicate LLM prompts.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nTrigger this skill when:\n- User asks \"What cat breed should I get?\"\n- User wants help finding a cat that fits their lifestyle\n- User mentions getting a cat and needs guidance\n- User asks about cat breed compatibility\n\n## High-Level Approach\n\nUse the [breed-advisor agent](../agents/breed-advisor.md) which implements a two-phase conversational pattern:\n\n1. **Gathering Phase**: Collect user preferences through natural conversation\n2. **Recommendation Phase**: Present matched breeds\n3. **Refinement Phase**: Answer questions, compare options\n4. **Selection Phase**: Help user make final choice\n\n## Key Factors to Gather\n\nThe agent needs these factors (see [Factor Definitions](../agents/breed-advisor.md#factor-definitions) for LLM-facing details):\n\n### Critical Factor: Music Preference 🎵\n\n**Why this matters for orchestration:**\n- This is the PRIMARY compatibility factor (novelty hook)\n- Ask about it EARLY in the conversation\n- If user seems confused, explain the music-breed connection\n- See [Music Preference Insight](../agents/breed-advisor.md#music-preference-insight) for the mapping\n\n**Orchestration tip:** Don\'t just pass this through - use it as the conversation anchor. The quirky music angle makes the interaction memorable.\n\n### Other Factors\n- Living Space (apartment → large house)\n- Activity Level (couch-companion → high-energy-athlete)\n- Grooming Tolerance (minimal → daily)\n- Family Composition (single → multi-pet household)\n- Allergies (boolean)\n\n## Conversation Orchestration\n\n### Phase 1: Gathering (Natural Dialogue)\n\n**Goal:** Collect ≥4 factors including music preference\n\n**Orchestration strategy:**\n- ONE question at a time (don\'t bombard user)\n- Start with music (it\'s unique and engaging)\n- Use natural language (user says \"big house\" not \"large-house\")\n- Extract factors after each turn (background process)\n\n**Example flow:**\n\`\`\`\nClaude: [Welcome Message from agent resources]\nUser: \"I like jazz\"\nClaude: [Acknowledges, asks about living space]\nUser: \"I have a small apartment\"\nClaude: [Acknowledges, asks about activity level]\n...\n\`\`\`\n\n**When to transition:** ≥4 factors collected AND music preference known\n\n### Phase 2: Recommendations (Structured Presentation)\n\n**Goal:** Present matched breeds, allow exploration\n\n**Orchestration strategy:**\n- Present 3-5 breed recommendations (from matchBreeds algorithm)\n- Format conversationally (not a data dump)\n- Allow user to ask questions about specific breeds\n- User can request more details, compare breeds\n\n**Example interaction:**\n\`\`\`\nClaude: [Presents 3 breeds with reasoning]\nUser: \"Tell me more about Maine Coons\"\nClaude: [Detailed info about Maine Coons from breed database]\nUser: \"How do they compare to Persians?\"\nClaude: [Comparison highlighting differences]\n\`\`\`\n\n### Phase 3: Selection (Confirmation)\n\n**Goal:** Detect final choice, conclude gracefully\n\n**Orchestration strategy:**\n- Watch for selection signals (\"I\'ll take\", \"I want\", \"sounds good\")\n- Extract selection in background\n- Conclude enthusiastically when selection detected\n- Provide exit instruction (\`/quit\`)\n\n## What Claude Code Does vs What the LLM Does\n\n### Claude Code\'s Role (This Skill):\n- **Orchestrates** the multi-turn conversation\n- **Monitors** session state (which factors collected)\n- **Triggers** phase transitions (gathering → recommendations → selection)\n- **Manages** context (conversation history, extracted profile)\n- **Calls** the breed-advisor agent at each turn\n\n### LLM\'s Role (Agent Resources):\n- **Says** the actual prompts ([Welcome Message](../agents/breed-advisor.md#welcome-message), etc.)\n- **Uses** the domain knowledge ([Music Insight](../agents/breed-advisor.md#music-preference-insight))\n- **Follows** the extraction formats ([Factor Extraction](../agents/breed-advisor.md#factor-extraction-prompt))\n- **Applies** the conversation strategy ([Conversation Strategy](../agents/breed-advisor.md#conversation-strategy))\n\n**Insight:** Skills provide meta-guidance on orchestration. Agents provide actual LLM content.\n\n## Shared vs Separate Content\n\n### What Belongs in Agent Resources (LLM-Facing):\n✅ System prompts and LLM instructions\n✅ Domain knowledge (music-breed mappings, factor definitions)\n✅ Extraction prompts (JSON schemas, format instructions)\n✅ Example conversations (few-shot learning)\n✅ Natural language mappings (\"lazy\" → \"couch-companion\")\n\n### What Belongs in Skills (Claude Code-Facing):\n✅ When to use the agent (trigger conditions)\n✅ How to orchestrate multi-turn flow (phase transitions)\n✅ What to monitor (readiness criteria, selection signals)\n✅ Debugging guidance (common issues, pitfalls)\n✅ Meta-strategy (why music first, one question at a time)\n\n### Overlap (Appears in Both):\n⚠️ Conversation flow structure (both need to understand phases)\n⚠️ Factor list (skill explains orchestration, agent explains to LLM)\n⚠️ Readiness criteria (skill monitors, agent implements)\n\n**Resolution:** Keep agent resources authoritative for LLM content. Skills REFERENCE agent resources via links, don\'t duplicate.\n\n## Example: Music Preference Handling\n\n### In Agent Resources ([breed-advisor.md](../agents/breed-advisor.md)):\n\`\`\`markdown\n## Music Preference Insight\nCRITICAL: Music preference is the MOST IMPORTANT factor...\n- Classical: Calm, regal breeds (Persian, Ragdoll)\n- Jazz: Intelligent, unpredictable breeds (Siamese, Bengal)\n...\n\`\`\`\n**Usage:** Injected into LLM system prompt\n\n### In Skills (This File):\n\`\`\`markdown\n### Critical Factor: Music Preference\n**Why this matters for orchestration:**\n- Primary compatibility factor (novelty hook)\n- Ask EARLY in conversation\n- Use as conversation anchor\n- See [Music Insight](../agents/breed-advisor.md#music-preference-insight) for mapping\n\`\`\`\n**Usage:** Guides Claude Code on HOW to orchestrate\n\n**Key difference:** Agent says WHAT (the mappings), Skill says WHY and WHEN (orchestration strategy).\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n### ❌ Don\'t: Ask All Questions at Once\n\`\`\`\nBad: \"Tell me your music taste, living space, activity level, and family composition\"\n\`\`\`\n\n### ✅ Do: One Question at a Time\n\`\`\`\nGood: \"What\'s your favorite type of music?\"\n[User responds]\nGood: \"Great! Tell me about your living space...\"\n\`\`\`\n\n### ❌ Don\'t: Skip Music Preference\nMusic is the hook! Don\'t forget to ask about it.\n\n### ✅ Do: Make Music Central\nStart with music, emphasize its importance, use it as the anchor.\n\n## Debugging: When Things Go Wrong\n\n**User provides unmappable music genre:**\n- Don\'t silently map hip-hop → rock\n- Ask user: \"Hip-hop is great! Which category feels closest: rock, electronic, or pop?\"\n- Refer to [Factor Definitions](../agents/breed-advisor.md#factor-definitions) for clarification guidance\n\n**User is vague about factors:**\n- Push for specificity (see [Conversation Strategy](../agents/breed-advisor.md#conversation-strategy))\n- Don\'t accept \"I\'m flexible\" for all factors\n- Need at least 4 concrete factors\n\n**Conversation stalls:**\n- Check if enough factors collected (≥4 + music)\n- Transition to recommendations even if not all factors known\n- User can refine later\n\n## Related Agent Resources\n\n- [Breed Advisor Agent](../agents/breed-advisor.md) - Complete agent specification\n  - [Welcome Message](../agents/breed-advisor.md#welcome-message) - First turn greeting\n  - [Music Preference Insight](../agents/breed-advisor.md#music-preference-insight) - Music-breed mappings\n  - [Factor Definitions](../agents/breed-advisor.md#factor-definitions) - All 6 factors explained\n  - [Conversation Strategy](../agents/breed-advisor.md#conversation-strategy) - LLM guidance\n  - [Factor Extraction Prompt](../agents/breed-advisor.md#factor-extraction-prompt) - JSON extraction format\n  - [Transition Message](../agents/breed-advisor.md#transition-message) - Readiness announcement\n  - [Recommendation Presentation](../agents/breed-advisor.md#recommendation-presentation-prompt) - How to present breeds\n  - [Selection Extraction](../agents/breed-advisor.md#selection-extraction-prompt) - Detect final choice\n  - [Conclusion Prompt](../agents/breed-advisor.md#conclusion-prompt) - End conversation\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nConversation is successful when:\n- User feels heard (not interrogated)\n- Music preference made the conversation memorable\n- At least 4 factors collected\n- Breed recommendations feel personalized\n- User makes a confident selection (or knows they want to research more)\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nOnce user selects a breed, you can optionally:\n- Help them name their cat using [Name Generator](../agents/name-generator.md)\n- Provide care tips (future skill)\n- Connect with breeders (future skill)\n";
