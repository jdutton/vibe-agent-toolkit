# Test configuration for collection-based validation
# Used by packages/resources tests to validate frontmatter schemas

resources:
  # Exclude test fixtures from crawling
  exclude:
    - "**/node_modules/**"
    - "**/dist/**"

  # Define test collections with different validation requirements
  collections:
    # Strict validation: no extra fields allowed
    guides:
      include:
        - "valid/guide-*.md"
        - "invalid/guide-*.md"
      validation:
        frontmatterSchema: "schemas/strict-guide.json"
        mode: strict

    # Permissive validation: extra fields allowed
    documentation:
      include:
        - "valid/doc-*.md"
        - "invalid/doc-*.md"
      validation:
        frontmatterSchema: "schemas/permissive-doc.json"
        mode: permissive

    # Skills validation: specific requirements for SKILL.md files
    skills:
      include:
        - "skills/**/*-SKILL.md"
      validation:
        frontmatterSchema: "schemas/skill-frontmatter.json"
        mode: permissive

# This config demonstrates:
# - Multiple collections with different schemas
# - Strict vs permissive validation modes
# - Pattern-based resource inclusion
# - Schema-based frontmatter validation
